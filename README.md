### Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:
npx create-react-app my-app

cd my-app

npm start
# To install dependencies(bmi_cal folder):
             npm install 
    
# To run the code: 
             npm start
